    "# Traveling Salesman Problem via Genetic algorithms\n",

    "## The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well known problem in Computer Science. It consists in finding the optimal (i.e. cheapest) tour which visits all cities in the instance, given a matrix of costs to travel from one to another. \n",

    "\\text{with}& \\qquad \\sum_{j=1}^N x_{ij} = 1 \\qquad i = 1, \\dots N \\quad (\\text{Exactly one incoming})\\\\\n",

    "It's NP-hard, therefore exact algorithms are unfeasible for non-trivial instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Genetic algorithms overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic algorithms (GA) are approximation randomized algorithms which iteratively optimize a partial set of viable solutions to a given problem, often called *chromosomes*. The optimization is carried out on a given *fitness* function, which in our case is the cost of a given tour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization happens by a peculiar process called *crossover*, which consists in merging two parent solutions into a new one, hopefully retained the best parts of the ancestors. Many *crossover operators* exist for the TSP problem, some of them are fully deterministic (e.g. `CX`, `CX2`), while others are based on a stochastic component (e.g. `OX`, `PMX`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to crossover, to further mimic natural biological evolution, GA leverage *mutation* to slightly modify a subset of exising chromosomes (choosed randomly). This often provides solutions not easily achievable by means of crossover, and is critical in fully exploring the solution manifold. Due to their intrinsic stochastic definition, mutation operator are always randomized procedures which operate on a single chromosome.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of the project\n",
    "\n",
    "We briefly describe the structure of the GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem was tackled using Python and Fortran 90, leveraging [f2py](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/index.html) to link the two languages. Python was used to develop the high level driver for the genetic framework, the problem loading and the data collection layer, and to perform final data analysis, due to its strong versatility. Fortran was used to develop the low-level mutation and crossover operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the link between Python and Fortran it has been possible to test the fortran code by using the high level Python testing framework [pytest](https://pytest.org), which among standard testing traits provides many comfortable features like a rich CLI and [fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/fixture.html).\n",
